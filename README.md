# WRIT 20833 Portfolio Template

**"When Coding Meets Culture: Developing Data-Driven Opinions"**  
Final Project Web Portfolio Component

## About This Template

This template is designed specifically for WRIT20833 students completing their final digital humanities research project. It provides a professional web portfolio structure for the **Web Portfolio (HTML/CSS)** deliverable described in the [Final Project Requirements](https://tcu-dcda.github.io/WRIT20833-2025/WRIT20833_Final_Project_Requirements.html).

### Project Context

Your final project explores **what happens when coding meets culture**, integrating:
- **Term frequency analysis** - Pattern detection in large text datasets
- **Sentiment analysis (VADER)** - Emotional tone and polarity measurement  
- **Topic modeling (Gensim)** - Thematic structure discovery
- **Traditional humanities methods** - Close reading, cultural interpretation, critical reflection

This portfolio template helps you present these integrated findings to public audiences, demonstrating how computational and humanities approaches reveal insights that neither could discover alone.

## Step-by-Step Customization

### Step 1: Edit HTML Content

Open `index.html` in your text editor (VS Code recommended) and look for `<!-- TODO: ... -->` comments. These mark exactly where to add your content.

**Quick Find & Replace:**
- `Your Name` → Your actual name (or "Team Name")
- `Your Project Title` → Your research project title
- `yourusername` → Your GitHub username (in footer)
- `project-name` → Your repository name (in footer)

### Step 2: Fill in Each Section

Map your research essay content to portfolio sections:

| Portfolio Section | Essay Section | What to Include |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Research Question** | Overview (100-300 words) + Research Question (200-300 words) | Your question, why it matters, background context, how it evolved from HW5 proposal |
| **Data & Methods** | Methods (400-800 words) + Dataset Documentation | Data sources, collection methodology, ethical considerations, sample size, preparation process, limitations, tools (Python, VADER, Gensim) |
| **Results & Analysis** | Findings (300-500 words) | Visualizations from notebooks, code examples demonstrating three base methods, sentiment patterns, topic models, term frequency results |
| **Key Findings** | Findings (300-500 words) | 3-5 numbered discoveries with supporting data, comparison to initial hypothesis, confidence assessment, gaps that remain |
| **Critical Reflection** | Integration & Reflection (200-300 words) + Public Presentation Strategy (200-300 words) | How computational and humanities methods integrate, what emerged that close reading alone couldn't reveal, connections to course frameworks, what you'd change, future directions |

### Step 3: Add Your Visualizations

1. **Export charts from Google Colab** as PNG files (see code example below)
2. **Save PNG files** in the `images/` folder
3. **Update image paths** in `index.html` to match your filenames

**Example: Exporting from Google Colab**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create your visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
# ... your plotting code ...

# Save as PNG
plt.savefig('sentiment-distribution.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
plt.show()

# In Colab: Files tab (left sidebar) → Right-click file → Download
# Then upload to GitHub in your portfolio's images/ folder
```

### Step 4: Include Code Examples

The template includes styled code blocks. Copy relevant Python code from your notebooks:

```html
<div class="code-title">sentiment_analysis.py</div>
<pre><code>from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
df['compound'] = df['text'].apply(
    lambda x: analyzer.polarity_scores(x)['compound']
)</code></pre>
```

### Step 5: Connect to Critical Frameworks

Use the special callout boxes to connect your work to course frameworks:

```html
<div class="framework-callout">
    <h3>📐 Classification Logic</h3>
    <p>This project demonstrates how algorithmic categorization...</p>
</div>
```

**Framework Options:**
- **📐 Classification Logic** - How algorithms categorize culture
- **🤖 AI Agency** - Power structures and pseudo-intelligence
- **🔒 Sacred Boundaries** - Privacy, ethics, digital divides
- **📚 Collective Memory** - Cultural preservation, digital archives

---

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Make your portfolio publicly accessible in 3 steps:

1. **Go to repository Settings → Pages** (left sidebar)
2. **Source:** Select "Deploy from a branch"
3. **Branch:** Select `main` (or `master`), folder: `/ (root)`
4. **Click Save**
5. **Wait 1-2 minutes**, then visit: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/your-project-name`

**Troubleshooting:**
- Make sure repository is **Public** (Settings → General)
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory (not in a subfolder)
- Allow 1-2 minutes for first deployment
- Refresh browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

---

## Working as a Group

**📖 For complete group workflow guide, see [VISUAL_GUIDE.md](VISUAL_GUIDE.md) Steps 10-15**

### GitHub Desktop Workflow (Recommended)

**Best for: Groups working on the same repository with frequent edits**

1. **Designate repository owner:**
   - Choose one person to create the repository from template
   - This person's GitHub account will host the repository
2. **Owner adds collaborators:**
   - Settings → Collaborators → Add people
   - Enter each teammate's GitHub username
   - Teammates accept email invitation
3. **Everyone clones the repository:**
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - File → Clone Repository
   - Select the owner's repository
   - Choose local save location
4. **Follow the Golden Rule: PULL → EDIT → COMMIT → PUSH**
   - **PULL:** Always click "Fetch origin" then "Pull" before editing
   - **EDIT:** Make your changes to your assigned section
   - **COMMIT:** Add descriptive message, click "Commit to main"
   - **PUSH:** Click "Push origin" to sync changes to GitHub
5. **Coordinate sections:**
   - Assign specific sections to each person
   - Communicate before editing: "Editing Methods section now"
   - Wait for teammate to push before you start editing
6. **Handle merge conflicts:**
   - GitHub Desktop will alert you if conflicts occur
   - Open conflicted file in text editor
   - Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
   - Choose which version to keep or combine both
   - Save file, commit, and push

### Communication is Key

**Before editing:**
```
"Pulling latest changes now"
"Editing Research Question - will take ~15 min"
```

**After editing:**
```
"Committed and pushed Methods section"
"Done! Safe to pull and edit now"
```

**Tools for coordination:**
- Slack / Discord / GroupMe / Text messages
- Regular check-ins via Zoom/Google Meet

### Division of Labor Example

**3-person group:**
- Person A: Research Question, Background → Session 1
- Person B: Data & Methods, Analysis → Session 2  
- Person C: Findings, Reflection → Session 3
- One person: Upload all images in one batch

**2-person group:**
- Person A: Research Question, Data & Methods, Reflection
- Person B: Analysis, Findings, Images

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Showing

**Problem:** Broken image icons or missing visualizations

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Verify PNG files are in `images/` folder (not `Images/` or `img/`)
- ✅ Check exact filename match (case-sensitive): `sentiment-chart.png` ≠ `Sentiment-Chart.png`
- ✅ Use relative paths: `images/chart.png` (NOT `/images/chart.png` or `C:/Users/...`)
- ✅ Refresh browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### CSS Not Loading

**Problem:** Plain HTML with no styling

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Verify `styles.css` is in `css/` folder (not root directory)
- ✅ Check `<link>` tag in `index.html` points to `css/styles.css`
- ✅ Clear browser cache and hard refresh
- ✅ Open browser developer tools (F12) and check Console for errors

### GitHub Pages Not Working

**Problem:** 404 error or site not found

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Confirm repository is **Public** (not Private)
- ✅ Verify `index.html` is in root directory (not in subfolder)
- ✅ Wait 1-2 minutes after enabling Pages
- ✅ Check Pages settings: Settings → Pages → Source should be "main branch"
- ✅ Visit exact URL: `https://username.github.io/repo-name/` (with trailing slash)

### Git Conflicts

**Problem:** "Merge conflict" when pulling or pushing

**Solutions:**
- ✅ **Don't panic!** Conflicts are normal in group work
- ✅ Talk with your group - coordinate who's editing what sections
- ✅ Use branches for separate work (see Working as a Group section)
- ✅ Ask for help in class or office hours - we'll walk through it
